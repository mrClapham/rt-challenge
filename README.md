# An empty app seed for ES6 projects

run:

```
$ npm install

```

Start the server with:

```
$ node server

```
This will start a server at [http://localhost:9080](http://localhost:9080) . Change the post in the server.js file if you prefer a different port.

Then build the project by running:

```
$ webpack

```


10:30 - starting with my es6 app seed. Thought about going for a vanilla js no-framework approach but sticking to the brief and using React/redux. Starting by npm installing all the dependencies.
