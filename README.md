# Swipe card test

run:

```
$ npm install

```

Start the server with:

```
$ node server

```
This will start a server at [http://localhost:9080](http://localhost:9080) . Change the post in the server.js file if you prefer a different port.

Then build the project by running:

```
$ npm run webpack-watch

```


10:30 - starting with my es6 app seed. Thought about going for a vanilla js no-framework, no-jQuery approach but sticking to the brief and using React/redux. Starting by npm installing all the dependencies.

Redux is overkill for a job of this size and took a fair chunk of the 3 hours to set up - that and webpack etc, but it is my preferred route if I'm going with a framework.

The master branch is where I got to in 3 hours - a rough and ready start.

It was a shame not to get it to a finished state so that is in the develop branch.
